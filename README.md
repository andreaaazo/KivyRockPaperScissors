## üí° How-We-Made-It

### Introduction

To create our GUI we used the `Kivy` framework.

```python
import kivy.utils as utils
from kivy.app import App
from kivy.uix.relativelayout import RelativeLayout
from kivy.properties import ObjectProperty, NumericProperty
```

With the `Kivy` framework we have created the app. The full game stays in the `MainWidget` class.

```python
class RockPaperScissorsApp(App):
    def build(self):
        return MainWidget()
```

<br />

### Realizing the GUI

Before start coding the GUI, we used Figma to create a prototype and setting up the aspect of our game.
We also draw the widget layouts to help us code faster, and to undestand better which layout to use.

The interface is fully coded in the `rockpaperscissors.kv` file.  
Check it out [here](https://github.com/andreaaazo/KivyRockPaperScissors/blob/main/rockpaperscissors.kv).

### Passing objects from `.kv` to `.py`

To pass the needed objects, firstly, we have declared some variables at the beginning of the widget definition in the `.kv` file:

```
<MainWidget>:

    ai_choice_img: ai_choice_img
    user_choice_img: user_choice_img
    scoreboard: scoreboard
```

Secondarly, we have assigned an `id` to the desired objects, with the same name of the variable:

```
Image:
  id: user_choice_img
  ...
```

In the `main.py` file we have declared the same variables, with the value `ObjectProperty(None)`:

```python
user_choice_img = ObjectProperty(None)
```

### Passing variables from `.py` to `.kv`

To update the text labels dynamically, we have declared some variables in the `.py` file. With the value `NumericProperty(0)` for an integer, and `StringProperty("")` for a string:

```python
ai_score = NumericProperty(0)
```

To pass the variables in the `.ky` file, we simply wrote `root.` before the declaration:

```
Label:
    text: str(root.ai_score)
```

### Writing the game mechanics

We wrote the mechanics in the `MainWidget()` class in the `.py` file.

We implemented `Threading` to help us to manage better the timing, and it gave us the ability to create some funny animations.

Every `Button` action, raises the `main` function and starts a new `Thread`:

```python
def main(self):
    self.change_user_choice_img()
    self.ai_turn()
    self.check_win()
    self.update_result_to_gui()
    self.reset_game()
```

To help us to manage the Bot animation we used the function `.join()`:

```python
def check_win(self):
        ai_choice = self.ai_choice
        user_choice = self.user_choice

        def start():
            # Wait for animation to end
            self.thread_ai_animation.join()
```

The game mechanic is fully coded in the `main.py` file.
